#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] understand what elecments contribute to a games look and feel
- [ ] how imporatant interface design is to a gameplay experince
- [ ] Uderstand color theory and it's contribution
- [ ]  what makes a game bad
-->

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Wrote case study for what a bad game is. (and realized how bad the games I play are)
  - I think i want to do a dungeon crawler territory expansion board game
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  -  N/A
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  -  N/A

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- How imporatnt UI elements is in a game, epxisally if it is intergrated well or "transparent". Also made me realize most gatcha games have the worst UI.
- Sound and ambience is also super important, expeially for more immersive experinces.
- Color pallet and theory can make the game more cohesive and immersive. 

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  Maybe not having sound is also part of sound design. ie: cut off all sound and ambince when a boss is coming in a horror game
-  Over cluttered HUD is a huge problem
-  Some games are great I should go back and play them again (Firewatch and Last of Us 2) 
<!--

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  
-->

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- I think I want to do a dungeon crawler game for my board game? Not super sure.
