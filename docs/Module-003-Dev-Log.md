### Date: 2/9/2026

#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] understand how to design game balance (mechanic, balance, reward) 
- [ ] Understand player balance (PVP, PVE)
- [ ] Play Atari game and learn from old game mechanics
-->

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - I played River Raid as my Atari game, and it was really cool as a vertical scorlling game. Wrote case study
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  -  N/A
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  -  N/A

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
-  Gmae balance is important, and players should be able to play, progress, and get rewarded proportionally
-  But hard games like souls like still have an aundience, has to be balanced
-  Doing a matrix like the rock paper scicceors, which is a perfect balaccned system (-1, 0, +1)

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  Why does people like souls like if its just pain and suffering?
-  What proportion of challange and reward is good?
-  Would the game be too predictable?
-  Design level, player, reward, effort, gameplay, mechanicas balance? 
<!--

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  
-->

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- I think I want to do a dungeon crawler game for my board game? Not super sure.
