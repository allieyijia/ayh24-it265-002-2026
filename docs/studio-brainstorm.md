## Vision Statement
*What is the mission of your solo game studio? How does it align with creating and analyzing innovative game architectures?*

> Stillfire Games creates cozy, story-driven indie games that feel like a warm light on a cold day.
Our mission is to design gentle yet meaningful interactive experiences that blend narrative, light action, puzzles, and social play. Games players can play themsevles to wind down after a long day, or to play with others. (the idea was "games to play with siblings"). I want to make games that invite reflection, comfort, and connection.

## Core Values
*What principles guide your studio's approach to game design, architecture, and development?*

- **Cozy First Design**
- The gameplay and interaction is designed to feel welcoming and comforting, even when exploring difficult themes or levels.

- **Story Through Play**
- Narrative is woven directly into mechanics, environments, and player choices matter. 

- **Easy to Pick up**
- Games are easy to pick up but meaningful to explore, with light action, puzzles, and systems that reward curiosity, not skill mastery. But players can pick up and easily play after not playing for a while, with easy controls and mechanics. 

- **Player-Centered Development**
- Design choices prioritize emotional well-being, accessibility, and play styles that support solo play, co-op, and family-friendly experiences.

## Unique Selling Point (USP)
*What will make your games stand out from others, particularly in the indie/board game space?*

> Games will blend cozy aesthetics with emotionally storytelling and light, accessible mechanics. Our games are designed to be played slowly, thoughtfully, and together, offering gentle challenges without high pressure or failure states. By integrating narrative themes such as dreams, anxiety, mental health, growth, and community directly into gameplay systems, hopefully create meaningful gameplay perfect for quiet evenings, rainy days, or shared moments with loved ones.

## Additional Notes
inspired by moments of quiet comfort: hot tea on a rainy night, soft light through a window, the feeling of being safe while exploring difficult emotions. And also I wanted to create a game studio that would make cozy indie games I could play with my sister, mom, or friends. It's games people can play when they want to play something, but not too demanding after a long day.
