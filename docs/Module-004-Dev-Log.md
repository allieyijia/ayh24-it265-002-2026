#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Undetstand game mechanics and how it contributes to game design in experince
- [ ] Elewments and balance of game design, espeically for diffrent types of games
- [ ] Case study of a game that does it well 
-->

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Did a color theory analysis on Atari River Raid, redesinged theme and UI
  - Undrstand modules of game mechanics
- **Challenges faced**:
  - n/a
- **Solutions**:
  - n/a

#### Learnings
- Honstly I hope I did the color theory case study better, and acutally redid the whole color theme
- And how games and mechanics balanece with difficulty and rewards
- Portal is super well made (espeically portal 2 I love it) 

#### Free Thinking
- Finish brainstarming for the midtern and finals. And also game treatmeant. I think for the treatment I'm gonna write about one of the games I had an idea about, like a more complicated one. And for midterm, I'm thinking if it could be combined with music?
<!--

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  
-->

#### Next Steps
- Braindstrom and finish the game treatment doc
- Know what to make for midterm and start making it/finalize idea
